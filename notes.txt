TODO
====
- Plan to phase out Subscriber model. Start by storing all extra info like phone_number in Radcheck.
- Remove the user_list variable from BulkUserUploadForm.save() if we don't need it.
- Add instructions to captive portal to aid standard and instant users, Windows and Mac users.
- Add __str__() to RechargeAndUsage model.
- Fix UI bug on 'View Users' page.
- Group admin should get a welcome email similar to group member's. The current one is similar to individual user's.
- Raise PermissionDenied error in decorators instead of 404.
- Dashboard should display vital information for all user types including user's package.
- Update tests.
- Move helper functions in all apps to a central utils package.

Urgent
======
- We should not just hide expired subscriptions in admin. Create a filter for this.
- Add date of purchase to package subscription and display it on dashboard.
- Set data usage to zero whenever a package subscription or group package subscription is created. Radacct contains usage info for reporting purposes.
- Check the logout link retrieval feature. Users should be able to get the Logout link when they visit the home page.
- We can display daily data usage info on dashboard. Ask whether this should be done or left as a reporting feature.
- Add some colour and info to 'logout' screen.

- Replace commas on vouchers with tabs.
- Do up VMS and Vendor UI. Use different colors and fonts.


Better user experience
======================
- Disable captive portal on Mac computers for all networks.
- Don't open the account creation page in a new tab.
- Have them create account in the same tab and give them a tour of the billing system upon first login. Also mention that they can always come back to the dashboard by clicking 'Manage Account' on the captive portal.
- Give them instructions on how to purchase their first package. List all payment methods MPower supports.
- After they purchase their first package, display a link that says continue here. This link should attempt to open a site (e.g. google.com) in a new tab. They would see the captive portal and log in to continue surfing the net.

- Ensure footer stays at bottom of page on all systems.
