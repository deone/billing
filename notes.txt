TODO
====
- Plan to phase out Subscriber model. Start by storing all extra info like phone_number in Radcheck.
- Remove the user_list variable from BulkUserUploadForm.save() if we don't need it.
- Add instructions to captive portal to aid standard and instant users, Windows and Mac users.
- Add __str__() to RechargeAndUsage model.
- Fix UI bug on 'View Users' page.
- Group admin should get a welcome email similar to group member's. The current one is similar to individual user's.
- Raise PermissionDenied error in decorators instead of 404.
- Dashboard should display vital information for all user types including user's package.
- Update tests.
- Move helper functions in all apps to a central utils package.

- Display 0 (zero) on template if data balance is negative.
- Set package volume to 100000 for unlimited plans (get_volume in utils/__init__.py)
- Display 'Cash Balance' on dashboard.

- Check how data billing works for instant vouchers.

Implement data balance for groups.
==================================
- Create a new column data_balance on GroupAccount model.
- Deduct group member usage from GroupAccount data balance in the same way we deduct individual usage from Radcheck data balance.

Implement data balance instead of usage.
========================================
- Increment data_balance by package volume every time a package subscription happens.
- Subtract data usage from data balance on Accounting-Stop.
- We can't add unlimited package volume to data balance. What do we do? (packages/forms and packages.admin)

Urgent
======

Grace period: 3 days

When is a user denied access to the service?
============================================
- When he exhausts his data.
- When he exceeds grace period without renewing subscription. In this case, he loses his remaining data.

What happens if subscription is not renewed after stop time?
============================================================
- Nothing happens. Grace period starts.

What happens if subscription is not renewed after grace period?
===============================================================
- Data balance is zeroed.

What happens when user renews subscription before current one expires or within grace period?
=============================================================================================
- Carry data balance forward and extend subscription time from current subscription stop time.

When does data balance ever get zeroed?
=======================================
- Grace period stop time.


- Check the logout link retrieval feature. Users should be able to get the Logout link when they visit the home page.
- We can display daily data usage info on dashboard. Ask whether this should be done or left as a reporting feature.
- Add some colour and info to 'logout' screen. We can make this screen a replica of the dashboard.
- Data should be recorded as balance instead of usage.

- Replace commas on vouchers with tabs. Add column headers.
- Do up VMS and Vendor UI. Use different colors and fonts.

New features
============
- Group Package Subscription expiry email notification.
- Distributed group volume billing.
- Automatic subscription renewal - Hold on.

We can save all the records sent in the 'Accounting Start' Response, just because. Investigate whether this is already done by FreeRadius SQL module.

Reports - should be available in PDF, CSV and XLS formats (according to scope document)
=======
Individual
----------
- Account Topup History - Standard Voucher
- Subscription Purchase History
- Session Duration History
- Data Usage History

Group
-----
- Payment History
- Subscription Purchase History
- Group/Group Member Session Duration History
- Group/Group Member Data Usage History

Better user experience
======================
- Disable captive portal on Mac computers for all networks.
- Don't open the account creation page in a new tab.
- Have them create account in the same tab and give them a tour of the billing system upon first login. Also mention that they can always come back to the dashboard by clicking 'Manage Account' on the captive portal.
- Give them instructions on how to purchase their first package. List all payment methods MPower supports.
- After they purchase their first package, display a link that says continue here. This link should attempt to open a site (e.g. google.com) in a new tab. They would see the captive portal and log in to continue surfing the net.

- Ensure footer stays at bottom of page on all systems.
