TODO
====
- Plan to phase out Subscriber model. Start by storing all extra info like phone_number in Radcheck.
- Remove the user_list variable from BulkUserUploadForm.save() if we don't need it.
- Add instructions to captive portal to aid standard and instant users, Windows and Mac users.
- Add __str__() to RechargeAndUsage model.
- Fix UI bug on 'View Users' page.
- Group admin should get a welcome email similar to group member's. The current one is similar to individual user's.
- Add hideShowPassword to password fields on 'Add User' page. Is this absolutely necessary.

- Validate package purchase form. Users get an error when they do not select any package and attempt paying with account balance.
- Dashboard should display vital information for all user types including user's package.
- Raise PermissionDenied error in decorators instead of 404.
- Redirect user to home page if they are logged in, even if they explicitly specify login url.
- Make username and password changes in VMS.
