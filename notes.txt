TODO
====
- Plan to phase out Subscriber model. Start by storing all extra info like phone_number in Radcheck.
- Remove the user_list variable from BulkUserUploadForm.save() if we don't need it.
- Add instructions to captive portal to aid standard and instant users, Windows and Mac users.
- Add __str__() to RechargeAndUsage model.
- Fix UI bug on 'View Users' page.
- Group admin should get a welcome email similar to group member's. The current one is similar to individual user's.

- Raise PermissionDenied error in decorators instead of 404.

- Dashboard should display vital information for all user types including user's package.
- Update tests.
- Ideally we should not just hide expired subscriptions in admin. Create a filter for this.
- Add date of purchase to package subscription and display it on dashboard.
- Should we display active subscription in subscription history on dashboard?
- Move helper functions in all apps to a central utils package.
- When individual users purchase packages upfront, dashboard displays last subscription purchased as active. Ideally, we should find the subscription that expires first after timezone.now() among all the upfront subscriptions. And we should have a header for unused subscriptions or pending subscriptions, and put expired subscriptions in 'Package Subscription History' and future subscriptions in 'Unused Subscriptions'.

Volume Billing
==============
Implement volume billing with sqlcounter Freeradius module.
Set Acct-Input-Octets and Acct-Output-Octets to 0;
- when individual user buys a package.
- when a group package subscription is created.


Better user experience
======================
- Disable captive portal on Mac computers for all networks.
- Don't open the account creation page in a new tab.
- Have them create account in the same tab and give them a tour of the billing system upon first login. Also mention that they can always come back to the dashboard by clicking 'Manage Account' on the captive portal.
- Give them instructions on how to purchase their first package. List all payment methods MPower supports.
- After they purchase their first package, display a link that says continue here. This link should attempt to open a site (e.g. google.com) in a new tab. They would see the captive portal and log in to continue surfing the net.

- Ensure footer stays at bottom of page on all systems.
